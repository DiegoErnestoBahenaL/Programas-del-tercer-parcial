Skytails are giant, winged monsters that live inside large thunderclouds such as the Thunderhead. They fly in winding, twirling motions, usually in small groups. When they spot Link flying his Crimson Loftwing, they will congregate on his location and charge at him and his bird, aiming to bite them with their large pincers. Their movements are meandering and unpredictable, making them difficult to avoid and damage.
